# PageRank

PageRank (developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin) revolutionized web search by generating a
ranked list of web pages based on the underlying connectivity of the web. 

*The PageRank algorithm is
based on an ideal random web surfer who, when reaching a page, goes to the next page by clicking on a
link*. The surfer has equal probability of clicking any link on the page and, when reaching a page with no
links, has equal probability of moving to any other page by typing in its URL. In addition, the surfer may
occasionally choose to type in a random URL instead of following the links on a page. The PageRank is
the ranked order of the pages from the most to the least probable page the surfer will be viewing.

In this notebook, you'll find a minified version of the PageRank algorithm.
